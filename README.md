# C---Binary-Search-and-Sorting and Dynamic Array Allocation
## Performs Binary and Linear Search and return the number of comparisons used. Also used Dynamic Array Allocation

### Four Functions:
1. ArrayCopy to perform deep copy and understand the difference between shallow copy and deep copy
2. myFavouriteSort performing Selection Sort
3. binSearch performing binary search and returning the number of comparisions and the index at which the value was found
4. linSearch performing linear search and returning the number of comparisions and the index at which the value was found.

#### Dynamic Array Allocation

Dynamic Array Allocation allows the space in an array to change during the course of the execution of a program. In C, this requires the use of the malloc() function.
